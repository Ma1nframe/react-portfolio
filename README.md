# UPDATE

I have put the React Development Journey on pause for now. I am seeking a position within Salesforce, and although React is supported on Visualforce Pages I am opting to dive all in on their Platform's flagship framework "Lightning Web Components". It isn't great by any means as an open source Javascript framwork but it suits Salesforce perfectly and it looks to be on the precibus of an explosion in growth over the next couple of years. Although they have designed their own version tracking system, I will be documenting my updates and learning guides through another repo here on GitHub as well for anyone that wants to follow along and learn one of the fastest growing in-demand Javascript frameworks.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created with parcel bundler

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs build.\
Runs build.\
Runs project to view in browser with live-server.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
